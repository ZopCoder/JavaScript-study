What did I learn today (12-03-2022) from the JS file "pizzaOrderingService.js"
1. The last promise from the "createOrder" function was resolving to "undefined"
2. Hence the last result was showing as "undefined"
REASON:
Inside .then() for the createOrder Promise I was putting the code inside {}, which 
means an explicit return is required. I was not returning the Promise explicitly.
I omitted the {},making it a default return statement and the Promise was returned 
and the code worked.
